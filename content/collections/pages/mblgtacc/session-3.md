The majority of us live in the “fly over zone;” Central, Midwestern, and Southern states where we are consistently isolated from resources and each other. Living in culturally conservative areas has a significant impact on forming relationships, attending work and school, and navigating self-care. This workshop discusses the varying avenues community building found within our struggle and resilience.'

            text: 'We are tired. As educators, students, activists, and especially as queer folx in 2022 we are being asked to do more with less and the stakes are high. This workshop session will invite participants to explore how we find needed rest while setting boundaries, finding and sharing resources of rest, and embracing the power of rest with a queer lens. We will look at ways to restore and repair in a time when so many of us are asked to take on unrecognized and uncompensated work for social justice and equity.'

In order to accommodate this growing group in your organization, work, or activism, a clear understanding of these identities is essential. This session builds that understanding, while highlighting specific intersectional issues that arise from systemic racism, ableism, and cissexism. Please take this unique opportunity to ask questions, participate in discussions, and connect with resources on aromanticism and asexuality!'

            text: 'Our afternoon The Dolls are Thriving extended session, part two of two, modifies portions of the award-winning “Queering Violence: Conversations about IPV, Sexual Violence and Trauma in LGBTQ and HIV+ Communities of Color” workshop, from SocialScope Productions, with case scenario group work to explore the complex ways violence and trauma affect queer and trans people of color and our communities. We know that violence directed at trans women of color, as well as femmes of color, is staggering. We also know that trans people of color are extremely creative, strong and resilient. This institute allows participants to reflect on multimedia clips from individual survivors and process the realities, complexities, and nuances in large and small group discussions. Participants will share any potential advocacy approaches and solutions to healing when working on anti-violence issues and the intricate ways a person’s identities intersect with their experiences coping. Participants will increase their ability to effectively advocate and understand different transformative justice healing options for queer and trans survivors of color, as well as how to empower survivors within their own, off-campus, community led initiatives and resources.
