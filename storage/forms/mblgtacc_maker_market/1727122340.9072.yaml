description: 'I am applying for the Maker Market. I am a rune reader, and I do rune casting divination.  I have a casting cloth that the querent will cast runes I provide onto and I will help them understand the meaning from where and how they fall. The activity is interactive and allows for introspection on personal concerns similar to Tarot or Oracle Cards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.'
