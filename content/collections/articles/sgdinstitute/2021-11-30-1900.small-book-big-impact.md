        text: "In terms of literal size, this book is small– the size of my hand, and thin– 86 pages long. Readers learn almost right away that this palm-ready publication mirrors the tradition of grassroots organizers circulating pamphlets to spread the word about their causes.\_ But don’t be deceived– this book is heavy, substantial, and one of those books you have to set down every few paragraphs to let out a hefty “whew,” absorb and dig back in once you’re ready."

        text: "amb gives a clear heads up about how and why she’s entering into this series of reflections and admissions. It’s evident that her drive to write this fuller work is rooted in both critique she’s received and her experiences in movement work. Her general tone is not one of convincing or positioning herself as an authorial voice, she emphasizes the collective “we” as she draws readers into her thought process. She doesn’t spend too much time breaking down a lot of introductory information beyond introducing herself to lay a grounding context for how she’s coming into this discussion.\_"

        text: "amb talks about the effects of social media making everything feel urgent and counters this with the idea of “real time” and that it “often includes periods of silence, reflection, growth, space, self-forgiveness, processing with loved ones, rest, and responsibility.”\_ Along this theme of pace, brown insinuates that the instantaneity and heightened urgency offered by social media can often restrict opportunity for deep understanding and clarifying questions to identify specific needs and evaluate for possible processes.\_\_"

        text: "Using a “call out” is not dismissed or discredited, but is nestled into amb’s fuller suggestion that it can be used as one tool among a wide arsenal of approaches in the interest of working through conflict, interrupting abuse, and transforming environments that can enable violence.\_ She speaks to the potential of call outs losing their effectiveness when misapplied to instances of conflict or misunderstanding rather than used in an attempt to disrupt and discontinue abuses that were otherwise ignored or persisting.\_ She encourages the idea of being in “generative conflict” by finding other tools to use in various scenarios, otherwise we risk there being no one left to “cancel.”\_"

        text: "Fear comes up as a recurring theme throughout the book, starting with a compelling ideation on the intuitive power of “discernment” – what amb explains as a “set of noticings, fears, wisdoms, deductions, and gut tremblings that want to save, or even just improve my life.”\_ She compares this to being frozen, unable to act or acting in unprincipled ways that contradict firmly held values around justice when we are operating under restraints of fear alone.\_\_"

        text: "She further contends with fear by highlighting that the instinct to be part of a “public feeding frenzy” is fueled by an anxiety that if we don’t participate, we could be seen as apologists or as uninvested in social change.\_ She says “we are fearful of taking the time to be discerning, because then we may have to recognize that we aren’t as skilled at conflict as we want and need to be, and/or that any of us could be seen as harm-doers.”\_"

In anticipated amb fashion, there are infinite questions posed both on the actual pages and inspired by reading through her grapplings.\_ As custom in her work, she also commits to citing and invoking the sources of her learning, embedding the names and teachings of those who have laid groundwork or provided perspective on her consideration of this larger work.\_ This is not a book to be underestimated for its short-length by attempting to rush through it because it will stop you cold in your tracks, draw gasps, and linger with you for infinite days after reading any section."
