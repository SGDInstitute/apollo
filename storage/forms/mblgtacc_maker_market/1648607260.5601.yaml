description: "Hello - my name is Quinn and I'm the proud co-owner and creator of Queen On The Scene. We are a 100% LGBT-Owned and 50% BIPOC business based in Sioux Falls, SD.  \r\n\r\nI design custom enamel pins and fierce gear specifically for my LGBTQIA+ community to support empowerment and fierceness. Our designs are 100% custom and unique to Queen On The Scene. \r\n\r\nThe best part of attending festivals as a vendor is connecting with my community on a personal level. I hear their stories. I am them and we are part of this amazing community. \r\n\r\nI started my business b/c I was sick of companies selling products that had no real investment in our LGBTQIA+ community past the sale. I set out to do better. I also happen to love enamel pins. \r\n\r\nI'm proud to be a supporter at festivals which we vend at, but we are in a growing phase and are not able to be the level of supporter that we hope to be. \r\n\r\n2020 was a beyond difficult year for small businesses and I was no exception. I'm honored and thankful to be able to attend festivals and events this year. \r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration!"
