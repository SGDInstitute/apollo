        text: '“We’re excited to celebrate this milestone, which comes at a consequential time in our collective history,” said Justin Drwencke, executive director of the Midwest Institute for Sexuality and Gender Diversity. “For nearly two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has layered its own challenges, hardships, and loss over systems of racism, state violence, and worker exploitation. I look forward to the rich and timely sessions and conversations we’ve come to expect from presenters and attendees, and we’re thrilled to safely welcome folks from all over the country to Columbus.”'
