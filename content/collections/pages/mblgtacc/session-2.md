Let’s address the issues of being an LGBTQ student on a rural campus; from finding each other, to starting an organization from scratch, to battling small-town isolation and administrative kickback. This workshop will present educational components within a facilitated discussion on how trans and queer people experience the challenges of rural higher education while also thriving as students and as people. A session created by Stefani Vargas.'

For queer and/or trans (QT) people it can be difficult to situate ourselves in this dialogue. These struggles can be exacerbated for QTBIPOC individuals who face unique experiences with accessing and navigating mental health care. This workshop will discuss ways to create spaces and support for QTBIPOC individuals’ specific challenges around mental health.'

We will also facilitate a discussion on the ways in which media affirms, disparages, or erases our identities.'

Whether advocating for change in our communities, working to quash Islamophobia or anti-Arab racism, or working on the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, non-Palestinian queer and trans accomplices can make a huge impact in the push for Palestinian liberation. This lecture makes the case for broad queer and trans solidarity with Palestinians from a variety of social justice and historical perspectives, and introduces attendees to the ins and outs of Palestine solidarity organizing.'

Along the way, we’ll get into gatekeeping, and the historical demographics of the hobby, and how the internet era has changed things.'

            text: 'In this session, the lives, works, and experiences of LGBTQ+ African Americans in history will be introduce to some and re-introduce to others. Significant times in history e.g., Harlem Renaissance, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movement, as well as the contemporary Black Lives Matter Movement, etc. will be discussed. We will also discuss Black Joy and how knowing our Black LGBTQ+ History is important to our overall Black Joy.'

Participants are encouraged (but not required) to sign along, and any and all levels of experience with American Sign Language and the Deaf community are welcome and encouraged to attend!'

            text: 'A growing number of folks over 40 are coming out queer, particularly into less-understood communities like the asexual and aromantic communities. They’re discovering their queerness online and attempting to find their place in IRL queer communities. In this presentation, we’ll learn who’s in this new generation of queer adults and we’ll look at ways to support their search for IRL community.'
