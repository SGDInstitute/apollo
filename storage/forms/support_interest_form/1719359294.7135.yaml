experience: "I have produced and edited for various podcast/radio projects for the past five years, most recently serving as a co-chair for the Queer Oral History Project for my college (Macalester College), preserving the stories and wisdom of queer student activists and alumni. \r\nThroughout my time as a co-facilitator for the A-Spectrum Identity Collective, I worked on creating posts for our Instagram account and regularly uploading digital announcement’s on my college’s email newsletter to promote our upcoming meetings. Being well-known as a co-facilitator, I regularly got questions from people in my DMs and in-person about the group that I answered. \r\nI would plan meeting topics with my co-facilitator, and in my aforementioned program assistant position me and my team of 3 organized multiple events throughout the year, including a large-scale Queer Prom in collaboration with two neighboring schools."
