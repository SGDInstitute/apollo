            text: 'Stone identity is as rich and complex as it is misunderstood and oversimplified. Unlike the term implies, stone identity is a place for warmth, growth, and physical fulfillment. Stone identities have existed for decades, and while research suggests that the number of stone people has remained relatively constant, the identity has seen a resurgence in popular queer culture. Delve into the history and politics of this complex sexual and emotional identity! This workshop is 18+.'

            text: 'In 1974 the first queer Star Trek fanfic was published, starring Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. Now, almost 50 years later, Kirk and Spock remain a much-loved fanfiction couple. Yet, much has changed in the ways we view gender and sexuality across the past five decades. In this session, I’ll discuss what fanfiction can tell us about changing cultural constructions of LGBTQ+ identities, through a comparative analysis of over 6, 000 pages of Kirk/Spock fanfiction.'

            text: 'It is often required to silence aspects of identity and hide our authentic selves in professional and academic settings. This educational workshop will explore the concept of queer deviance as it relates to kink/BDSM, romantic relationship structures, the conflation of sexuality with sex, sexual health, and heteronormativity. This critique of social sanitization and how to resist it will give participants tools to ask questions and challenge mandates in their lives.'

            text: 'How desirability often isolates and obscures the perspectives of queer disabled, Black, Indigenous and people of color when our inclusion is vital for liberation. In this session, we will explore how structures like white supremacy and ableism inform our notions about who has voices worth valuing and what can be done to tread the path of liberation together.'
