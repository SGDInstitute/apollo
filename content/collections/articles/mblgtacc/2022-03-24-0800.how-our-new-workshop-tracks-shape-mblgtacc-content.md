It is essential we dedicate time and attention to pleasure, joy, wellness, and healing in order to sustain ourselves, our communities and our movement.\_"

Queer and trans folks are highly represented among those on the front lines, in medic tents, and leading mutual aid projects.\_"

We want to recognize this work and hold space for these roles who often attend the conference with their student groups.\_\_"
