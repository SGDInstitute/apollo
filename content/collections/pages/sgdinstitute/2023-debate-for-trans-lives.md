The 7th annual Trans(Gender) Justice Teach-In brings together trans, nonbinary and two-spirit elected officials who have a front-row seat to the mess and complexity of legislative debates around trans lives. We’ll discuss panelists’ motivations to run for office, their experiences on the legislative floor, how they navigate their positions when anti-trans and other oppressive legislation comes up, and how Trans Refuge Bills can offer a pathway to improved living conditions for trans, nonbinary, two-spirit and intersex people.
