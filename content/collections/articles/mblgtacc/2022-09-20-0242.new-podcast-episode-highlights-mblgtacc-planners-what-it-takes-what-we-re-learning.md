All three organizers have worked on programming for the event and talked a bit about the overall approach, using the theme as a tool to focus conversation, and what most excites them about the conference.'

        text: '"When we talk about ''limitless,'' I can personally talk about myself... We''re navigating this college scene where we''re afforded the chance to express ourselves in a way that we might have not been able to at home," Lulu said. "Here at Ohio State, here in the Midwest, away from where I grew up, it''s almost like those options became limitless because I was able to branch out from what I knew and self-explore my identities, and also talk to people who have been through similar issues, and just thrive as a person."'
