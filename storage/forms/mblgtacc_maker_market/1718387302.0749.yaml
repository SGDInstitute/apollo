description: 'Hello!  The Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the School of Education at UW-Madison would like to participate in the vendor fair again.   I also don''t know if we are considered a "large" or "small" business.  As an office, our budget would classify us as a "small" business.  The university as a whole would absolutely be a large business, but we are using our office funds for this (not campus funds).  Last year, we gave $350, so if we could do that again, that would be lovely.'
