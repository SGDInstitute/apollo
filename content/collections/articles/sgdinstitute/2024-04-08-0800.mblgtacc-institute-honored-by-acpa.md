        text: 'The Midwest Institute for Sexuality and Gender Diversity continues to build on the 33 year legacy of LGBTQ+ college students and those who support them curating intentional, educational space for our communities. "These third spaces break the mold and showcase that there are different and exciting possibilities we can tap into for generating knowledge, sharing skills, and combating institutional oppressions," Brooks added. "Often deemed ''flyover country'' the Midwest is not looked at as a possibility model for systems change, gender justice, and sexual liberation. We know better."'
