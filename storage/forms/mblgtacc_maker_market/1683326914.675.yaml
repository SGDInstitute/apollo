description: "Deviant Kreations, is a neuro-divergent and queer art boutique founded by Dandy Knopf and co-owned by Phoenix Flaxman. Our business is focused on making a change. It is rooted in intersectionality, mental health, peoples rights and committed to helping other marginalized communities. We want to provide access to art that is as unique as you are at every price point.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in our quirky and fun stickers, prints, pins, buttons, and handmade items. Our products feature a range of topics, from quirky pun related artworks, to whimsical imaginative works. You can find examples of our art on Instagram @devkrea or online at www.deviantkreations.com.\r\n\r\nWe partner with our local queer safe space to help make our small town friendly and safer for our LGBTQIA+ community. And we would love the opportunity to connect with other queer people and artisans within this event.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering us! \r\n\r\n-Dandy and Pheonix"
