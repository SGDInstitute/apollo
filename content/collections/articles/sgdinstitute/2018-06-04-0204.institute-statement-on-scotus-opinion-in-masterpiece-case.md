The ruling of this case speaks specifically on this situation. SCOTUS opted to maintain a fair judicial process and determine that Phillips’ treatment during the Commission’s questioning did not result in a fair process."

        text: "\_SCOTUS did not indicate that the baker was in the right to refuse the gay couple service. In fact, several statements throughout the opinion provided by the justices asserts that discrimination based on sexual orientation is unconstitutional. The SCOTUS ruling is not a license to discriminate based on sexual orientation.While this opinion is not a direct loss for our queer and trans+ community, it is still prudent to acknowledge that major political moments can have ripple effects that cause an uptick in discriminatory violence. There is a clear pattern where political decisions that negatively impact various identity groups embolden those who hate us most to call for greater, more public, and more abhorrent treatment of those groups. One example is the sharp increase in single-incident homicides of LGBTQ+ people following the 2016 presidential election. According to the\_"

The opinion from SCOTUS makes it abundantly clear that this will not be the last time they are asked to add further clarification on where the line is between religious freedom and discriminatory practices against queer and trans+ people.In the meantime, rather than wait for a judicial decision to tell us what we already know, we must do what we always do: fight.

Check in with each other, uplift those who have the surge of energy to strike at times you might not, and pace yourself. The (in)justice system is a complicated and often short-sided mechanism for achieving true equity but it requires changing all systems to obtain our collective liberation. So when the next fight is bigger than a multi-tiered wedding cake, we must rise to the occasion. It’s the yeast we can do.'
