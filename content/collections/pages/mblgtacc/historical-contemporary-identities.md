During sessions in this track you will learn about sapphic history from the 19th century through today. Presenters will delve into discussions of personal and community identity development and explore the implications of homophobia, transphobia, racism, and fatphobia on the words we use and the way we structure our lives.'

It often seems like we’ve lost queer politics in lesbian spaces. This lecture seeks to debunk the notion that transness and lesbianness are at odds, and explore radical potentialities of new lesbian spaces! Take a journey through the unexamined genderqueer parts of lesbian history through a trans dyke lens.'

Stone identities have existed for decades, and while research suggests that the number of stone people has remained relatively constant, the identity has seen a resurgence in popular queer culture. Delve into the history and politics of this complex sexual and emotional identity! This workshop is 18+.'

In this session, we will discuss the coevolution of butch and femme identity and community, the backlash against and erasure of these identities, and the resilience of the communities in the present day.'

TERF Wars dives into the many facets of sapphic sexuality, gender, and orientation, to help you figure out what the L is going on.'
