        text: ', “Queer Joy as Our Lasting Legacy.”Publicly using a chosen name for the first time. Ripping down a poster promoting an anti-trans speaker. Snuggling up to housepets, propagating yet another plant, cooking a hearty meal for friends, binging a show with reasonable representation. These are all practices and rituals that prioritize queer and trans joy–and it is these practices that are the lifeforce of our communities.'

        text: 'We’re all acutely aware of the devastating battles we are facing and there is plenty of need to continue planning, strategizing, and educating each other to elevate us as a collective force. Centering queer and trans joy is not a distraction from the tumultuous and alarming status of our world, but an intentional grounding in the pleasure, desire, laughter, intimacy and majesty that always ushers us through our hardest moments.'

        text: 'Positioning queer joy as our lasting legacy is a direct counter to the current status of our struggles, a proclamation that we choose to celebrate ourselves as a response to threats rather than surrender. Invoking this theme for MBLGTACC 2023 drives us to curate a space that feels like a collective sigh of relief, allowing us to set down our battle-gear for a few moments and be nurtured by the healing powers of queer joy and contribute to our lasting legacy.'
