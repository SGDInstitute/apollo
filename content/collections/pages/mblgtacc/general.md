As a gay 15-year-old Olympic bound athlete, I was sexually abused by the adults entrusted in my training. Through this narrative, I will help the audience understand a victim''s perspective of being groomed, the choice of not reporting, and the long-term effects.'

We will explore the meanings and histories of the institution of marriage, compulsory sexuality, and related topics, and brainstorm how we can resist these punitive ideologies and organise as a community outside of such structures.'

This critique of social sanitization and how to resist it will give participants tools to ask questions and challenge mandates in their lives.'

In this session, I’ll discuss a history of bisexuality and bisexual activism in the U.S. I’ll also delve into the stigma surrounding bisexuality, and discuss the plethora of ways that bisexuality is misunderstood.'

Research has shown that negative self-talk causes inflammation, attacks the immune system, causes pain and discomfort, and possibly leads to disease(s) and death. I will share my journey of discovering ways to ease the inflammation, change the story I tell myself, and dare to live as my authentic self.'

In this presentation, participants will learn about the current state of PrEP, including the addition of cabotegravir (Apretude) for prevention. Concurrently, we will also overview the historical context to how PrEP was made possible because of the activism from the fight for HIV medication in the 1980s and 1990s.'
