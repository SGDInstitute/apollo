What was technically unnamed, but conceptually present in this part of our discussion is that this work still requires preserving our energy. Therefore, we are wise to note the difference between those who just wish to antagonize us and diminish our vision versus those who, even when there’s significant ideological differences between you, can be engaged with in generative ways.\_"

We are surrounded by daily actions and behaviors that deliberately reject systems of policing and imprisonment devised by those who have long-since learned that they are targets of state-sanctioned violence against their existence. With each wave of uprising against police brutality, we see community-based practices that were previously illegible to the general public suddenly adapted and put in place in other communities. Practices such as mutual aid became more common-place in response to the impact of both COVID-19 and the murder of George Floyd. But mutual aid and the sourcing of materials needed by community members is hardly new, it’s just possible it’s existed in our communities on such a small scale that we wouldn’t be aware of its existence unless we interacted with the resource directly.\_ We need only scan our communities to discover models that could be adapted or scaled-up as tactics for eliminating systems of policing and imprisonment."

        text: "This space reminded me of my initial invitation into abolition and how I originally compartmentalized it from the queer and trans liberation work I was involved with because I wasn’t seeing the linkages and overlaps. Over the years these seemingly separate aspirations of change have melded together and this deep reflection with Qui, Justin, Dominique, and Ar’Tesha revealed more connections and possibilities for alignment. Like anything that’s practiced, I believe embodying abolition requires commitment, repetition, study, and execution. This conversation was a testament to how putting concepts and ideas into practice plants seeds that will flourish into nourishment in our liberated future.\_\_"
