  The Maker Market is an exciting, new, and interactive part of the Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender Asexual College Conference.

  At the 30th annual MBLGTACC, we're creating space specifically to highlight and support queer and trans makers in the region and around the country. The Maker Market invites conference attendees and vendors to buy, sell, and trade their creations, and to participate in maker stations such as design-your-own-swag tables, prize giveaways, arts and crafts, skill-share demos, and much more!
