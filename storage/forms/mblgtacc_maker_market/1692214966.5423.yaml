description: "This would be my third MBLGTACC as a representative for the Smith College SSW. And though I go to a lot of other events and fairs in my position, this is one of my personal favourites. I am an Out Queer Trans Woman myself and I treasure the opportunity to  reach out to younger folks from our incredible range of communities.\r\n\r\nI've included our more formal description of the school itself below.  But it may be helpful to know that due to the unique structure of our program, our students come Smith College for three consecutive summer sessions, and between those, they do their internships with agencies we work with all over the U.S., including a number in and near the Midwest.\r\n\r\nSmith College School for Social Work offers a single focus on clinical social work education that integrates comprehensive educational theories, skills and practices of clinical social work. \r\n\r\nOur low-residency program alternates concentrated summers of rigorous on-campus education in Northampton, MA with off-site training from September to April at leading clinical or research sites around the country.\r\n\r\nOur post-graduate Professional Education offerings take it a step further, keeping you on the cutting edge of clinical social work through a variety of online coursework designed to fit your schedule and the “new normal.”\r\n\r\nSmith SSW encourages applications from people of all genders and backgrounds. \r\n\r\nGo beyond traditional practice with Smith SSW.\r\n\r\nM.S.W. | Ph.D. | Advanced Standing | Certificate Programs | Clinical Research Institute"
