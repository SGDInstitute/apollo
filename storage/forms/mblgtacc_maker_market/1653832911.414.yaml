description: 'Songs of Ourselves provides writing workshops, zines, and resources for LGBTQIA+ (including those who are questioning!) people. We do not believe in labeling writing as "good" or "bad" but instead intend to empower queer and trans people to use writing in ways that feel good to them. Our zines provide opportunities for self exploration and discovery, mindfulness, self-compassion, affirmations, and creating realistic intentions for building a writing practice. We have created these zines (and affirmation stickers!) for people to self-guide their reflective writing! Our current zine titles include Writing Prompt for Queer Self-Discovery, Writing Through Transition, and Writing Prompts for Sexual Liberation.'
