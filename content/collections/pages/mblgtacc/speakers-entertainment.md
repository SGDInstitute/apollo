            text: 'Mia Mingus is a writer, educator and trainer for transformative justice and disability justice. She is a queer physically disabled korean transracial and transnational adoptee raised in the Caribbean. She works for community, interdependence and home for all of us, not just some of us, and longs for a world where disabled children can live free of violence, with dignity and love. As her work for liberation evolves and deepens, her roots remain firmly planted in ending sexual violence.Mia has been involved in transformative justice work for almost 2 decades. She is a prison abolitionist and a survivor who believes that we must move beyond punishment, revenge and criminalization if we are ever to effectively break generational cycles of violence and create the world our hearts long for. She is passionate about building the skills, relationships and structures that can transform violence, harm and abuse within our communities and that do not rely on or replicate the punitive system we currently live in. Mia speaks and gives trainings about transformative justice throughout North America.Mia was a member and part of helping to create the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative from 2005-2010 and later Program Director for 2 years at Generation5 before the organization closed down. She was a founding and core member of the Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective from 2011-2020. Over the past 2 decades, she has supported numerous groups, organizations, individuals, intimate networks, families and communities in addressing harm, violence and abuse using transformative justice.Mia helped to create and forward the disability justice framework. Her writings on disability have been used around the world and are a regular part of college and university curricula. Her blog, Leaving Evidence, has become a staple resource for anyone wanting to learn about disability and she has coined language and concepts such as “access intimacy,” “magnificence,” “politically and descriptively disabled” and “forced intimacy.” Mia has played a key role in connecting disability justice with other movements and communities and she has worked tirelessly to educate different communities about disability, ableism, access, disability justice and abled supremacy.Her writings can be found on her blog, '

            text: "Saint Saunter (aka Sarah Akawa) (she/her) spins a mix of genres from club, pop/mainstream, house, and solid throwbacks. Much more than a DJ, Saint Saunter is creator of Madison's favorite queer multi-genre festival Hot Summer Gays alongside Dyke Dive. She has been creating queer nightlife spaces since her early days in Madison at the now defunct Plan B in collaboration with Tina She of The-L-Word-famous hip hop duo, God-des & She. After She Said Parties ended, Saint then created her long standing series QueerIRL which has held art pop ups, slow jam nights, and other events. Saint Saunter can also be found spinning at Dyke Dive, Madison-based house group JAMS, Madison and other Midwest PrideFests, and various local Madison venues. Seemingly oddly, Saint Saunter’s start in music comes from emo / pop punk music. She began her career as a promoter as a young teenager throwing shows for other teens, primarily booking emo bands in her hometown of Stevens Point, Wisconsin. That makes more sense when you find out that her side and passion project is Emo Nite Madison and Pop Punk Pizza Party; nights that celebrate her root love of emo and pop punk music. As a queer Asian woman in a white /cis / male dominated field she has delighted in mentoring other people of color and queer DJs, “I feel like it has been a huge gift to share my love of DJing and nightlife with the community and helping to uplift more queer and POC DJs around Madison”.\_\_Recently, Saint Saunter has joined Milwaukee’s No Stress Collective, which is a party collective of DJs, party planners, photographers, creating amazing dance parties for people who love to dance. Their motto is “Always Fun. No Hate, No Ego, No Stress”. Ultimately, Saint Saunter says its all about the community and friends that are made at her parties, “None of this would be worth anything without the people who come out, sweat, dance, meet new and old friends, and have fun. The community we create depends on every single person who comes through the door, and it makes it all worth it.” Whatever the night, genre, or location, Saint Saunter is always bringing together the queer community for dancing, fun, expression, and to celebrate the queer community. Lastly, Saint Saunter encourages those who are seeking to make a space that is needed to reach out to her: “I’m a huge collaborator, nothing is worth doing without friends alongside you.”"
