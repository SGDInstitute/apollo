For me, the move to the ''A'' standing for asexual means being able to recognize queerness encompassing several amazing things and all the ways to express them. I''m so glad that we are taking steps to help the people in this community feel safe and seen.”'

This isn''t the end of the work on behalf of asexual students, Brooks added. "Today, that progress is in name, and moving forward it will also be rooted in practice as we continue to build coalition with the asexual community to truly expand our program to center these experiences.”'

The name was updated again in 1997 to center transgender students (MBLGTCC), and in 2001 to add “ally” (MBLGTACC). Each of these changes came about through the efforts and initiative of students and student organizers.'
