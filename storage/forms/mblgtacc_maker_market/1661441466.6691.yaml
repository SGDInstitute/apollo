description: 'We are looking to table at this event to provide information on our college and to recruit/build network with current/recent grads at this conference. We will not be selling anything only serving as an informational hub for College of the Holy Cross How can I go about reserving a table. Also as a trans academic professional I would like to attend as a participant is there a way to register for both the conference and tabling at the same time?'
