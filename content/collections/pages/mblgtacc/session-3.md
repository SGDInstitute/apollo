Research shows that LGBTQ+ youth have a limited number of adults they feel comfortable talking with about sex/sexuality. This leaves folks to seek information online or from peers- unfortunately, information is often not specific and may be misinformed. This session, created by Stefani Vargas with today’s presenters, provides LGBTQ+ specific education focused on pleasure, identity, and history. 18+; frank discussions of sex.'
