Fulfilling this work is an iterative process, taking what has been executed previously and adjusting, adapting, and re-envisioning according to new social situations and changing contexts. Our work requires constant analysis, exposure, and consideration of these situations and contexts in order to both model improved practices as well as contribute to continued efforts and fights for our collective liberation.\_ We do not see ourselves as leaders of liberation, but as contributors and facilitators, participating in, creating and holding space for others to also be exposed to and inspired by new possibilities.\_"

            text: 'We credit the first iteration of our framework and guiding principles to the expended labor of liberation contributors before us. Over the course of this drafting process, we have examined and unpacked our interpretations of several existing philosophies. Of particular import are three texts which supported us in determining our role in this work. First, Incite!’s The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond the Non-Profit Industrial Complex provided us with ample questions to reflect on our individual and collective motivations for this work. Second, the Combahee River Collective statement offered a powerful template that was upfront about motives while also honest about limitations to a vision of social change. Third, the Black Lives Matter guiding principles, formulated as a “What We Believe” statement, offers a modern lens on current circumstances and context. These texts, in addition to other readings consumed for our individual self-work, have been vital in conceptualizing and articulating our own principles for how we approach social change work.'

            text: "Our beginnings lay the foundation for our modern movements. The advent of higher education was not crafted with queer, trans and intersex people, Indigenous peoples, Black & Brown people, disabled folx, and/or women in mind. The crafting of these institutions was based on a hegemonic ideology that served to maintain a patriarchal, nationalist status quo and has been resistant to expansion and inclusion in perpetuity.\_ Any gains for systemically disenfranchised people has prompted aggression-turned-violence from those already affirmed by these institutions. Increases in representation, recognition, and admission into higher education has come as a result of immense strategizing and revolting from those ostracized. No improvements for these groups has come out of the sheer goodness or empathy of administrative powers, all progress has been achieved by fighting for it.\_"

            text: "Institutions of higher education have been arenas for liberatory efforts throughout the existence of colleges and universities. Over the course of nearly four centuries, we still do not see ample and abundant possibilities for all people within institutions of higher education. In our modern context, we see clearly that students on college campuses are intricately involved in broader movement work, deeply engaged with the larger issues of the world through a variety of channels. Simultaneously pursuing formal education while also dedicating oneself to causes and movement work is an underestimated and underappreciated form of social and civic engagement. Through this dual engagement, college students advocating for change on their campuses contribute to a ripple that does not solely impact institutions of higher education, but is broadcast and integrated into our society as a whole.\_\_"

However, the bureaucratic and corporatized elements of higher education enable the continued erasure and dismissal of and violence against these very students both on and off campus. Therefore, this work is guided and inspired by more than just the efforts of college students and scholarly activists within academia. Students have routinely contributed to filling gaps and addressing the needs of systemically disenfranchised people. Their advocacy and activism on college campuses has resulted in identity-based centers, academic programs, staff positions, officially recognized student organizations, and a great deal more.\_"

It’s important to recognize and name that the history we are left to review is often patchy and incomplete, a result of restrictions regarding whose stories should be documented and archived. Part of our work is to pursue and establish a more complete history, from our origins to now, in an effort to capture the full arc of our organizational narrative. We are grateful for the milestones we have on record and seek to expand on these plot points. For now, this is the timeline we’re able to confirm.\_"

This came at a time when the continued growth of the mainstream lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights movement—largely underrepresenting transgender, nonbinary, and intersex folx—was most present and powerful on the east and west coasts, isolating students in the Midwest from national LGBT work by geography, political realities, and access to resources.\_\_"

They wanted to be part of the solution; to give a voice to queer students in the Midwest; and to make it and MBLGTACC a destination for acclaimed entertainers, activists, and thought leaders. They sought to create an oasis in what Justin Connor (MBLGCC ‘94) says was seen as a “queer desert.” The group came together a year later to lay down the organizing principles and logistical roadmap for a conference of LGBT students, to be held each year at a college or university in the Midwest. The inaugural MBGLCC was held at Iowa State University in February 1993, a collaborative effort between students at Iowa State and Drake University.\_"

After the first MBGLCC, the identities listed in the conference name were reordered to the “Midwest Bisexual, Lesbian, and Gay College Conference” for the 1994 conference. In 1997, “transgender” was added and the conference name was expanded to the “Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender College Conference.”\_ In 2001, the name was expanded again to the “Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Ally College Conference”. The most recent change was in late 2018 when the name was changed to the “Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender Asexual College Conference”. In 2017, MBLGTACC held its 25th gathering. The conference was hosted by the Chicago Coalition of Queer and Allied Students (CCQAS) in Chicago, IL."

However, we do believe this recurring space contributes to planting seeds, mobilizing and motivating students who will have broad influence wherever their post-college pathways take them. Our gathering provides opportunity for others to expand their language and analysis while being exposed to narratives that challenge and contradict one’s pre-existing knowledge and worldviews. As the largest and oldest continuously running conference for queer and trans college students, we often serve as a checkpoint or model for other similarly styled programs in other parts of the country. We are literally putting Midwest queer and trans student advocacy and activism on the map. The longevity of this conference cannot solely be attributed to any logistical or innovative miracle, but speaks more directly to the driving power of need—what happens when there is an assumed deficit or scarcity of resources, opportunities and points of connection for a systemically disenfranchised group. It is no accident that thousands of people return each year to the conference, but we know the conference is not enough.\_"

Through adherence to these guiding principles we hope to gravitate toward new opportunities and coalitions that will amplify and uplift the needs of queer and trans people in the Midwest.\_"

Oppression is not new and the long-standing historical implications of the ways these systems have created (and still create) confines and limitations, and contributed to historical and intergenerational trauma, is a reality that must be acknowledged. Trauma-informed movement work ensures that the impact of pain and violence enacted through systems of oppression is not erased. We are all carrying versions of trauma doled out through systems of oppression and we must be mindful of how that impacts our collective movement work.\_"

Our objective should always be to work ourselves out of the most recent self-assigned tasks rather than building longevity and legitimacy to our agencies. Organizations will not lead us into liberation, people will, so expending energy to sustain our offices distracts from building and sustaining the power of people.

It is important to honor and maintain the origins of concepts created within movements that name and define specific circumstances because the task of naming and (re)defining is a tool of liberation. Additionally, there must be ways for those on the periphery or outside of that movement or circumstance to be exposed to those concepts, otherwise the tool can lose its power. We must find a balance between simplifying language in order to avoid maintaining elitist standards of language while also protecting concepts created to explain specific and particular experiences. Without citing and crediting these concept creators, we risk ostracizing those who may not have access to tools or research to learn about these concepts. Without normalizing and protecting the origins of these concepts, we risk over-simplifying their meanings and enabling the use of buzzwords, the use of social change language in the wrong context or without proper application.\_"

This fluidity and personal connection with language is an important narrative to uplift when talking about the power of language and the negative impact of misusing/ignoring language by those who may not carry their own personal ties to terms and labels in ways queer and trans people commonly do.\_\_"
