I assumed everyone felt this uncomfortable, I assumed there were no other options. So I put up barriers, thinking that I needed to simply make the best of it—“don’t let anyone see your discomfort,” I thought.'

        text: 'When I got to college, being gay was relatively easy. I was fortunate to attend a university with a wealth of resources and several student organizations to choose from. In my second year, I attended the 19th MBLGTACC and after a 50-minute bus ride to Ann Arbor, Michigan, I encountered a world of queerness that I could have never imagined. But, my barrier was up and it was strong. I dismissed any possibility that I could be anything other than a cis, gay man.'

I sought out queer spaces and as I did, I observed ethereal non-binary folx subvert cisheteropatriarchy. Slowly, I began to unpack my own understandings of masculinity and gender. Now, I am in the process of coming out as genderqueer.'

I’m excited about Love, Simon. I’m going to watch it again and I acknowledge the film’s importance. Increased gay and lesbian representation in TV and film is critical, but where are the non-binary possibility models?'
