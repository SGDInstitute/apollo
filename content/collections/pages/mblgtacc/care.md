            text: 'There’s no doubt that the last three years since the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic have amplified what marginalized groups already know to be harsh conditions, hard fights, and continued struggle. Experiences of burnout, disruptions to existing organization and education efforts, and constantly reacting to waves of injustice have weighed heavily on queer and trans communities. It is essential we dedicate time and attention to pleasure, joy, wellness, and healing in order to sustain ourselves, our communities and our movement.'

This workshop session will invite participants to explore how we find needed rest while setting boundaries, finding and sharing resources of rest, and embracing the power of rest with a queer lens. We will look at ways to restore and repair in a time when so many of us are asked to take on unrecognized and uncompensated work for social justice and equity.'
