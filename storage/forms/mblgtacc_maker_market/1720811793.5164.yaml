description: "I am the director of the Bard Queer Leadership Project (BQLP) at Bard College at Simon's Rock, a small liberal arts college in Great Barrington, MA. The BQLP at Simon’s Rock aims to elevate LGBTQIA+ college graduates into leadership roles in fields across the workforce. The centerpiece of BQLP is a four-year dual-major B.A. degree program combining Queer Leadership with a second academic field. It is envisioned to expand over the next few years into a complete college on our Simon’s Rock campus."
