Then, we’ll lead attendees through a guided activity to perform their own “mini interviews”. This section will broaden the participants’ understanding of who gets to be a historian and whose stories count as “historical”. By emphasizing community experiences and knowledge, we hope to enter the workshop with two oral historians, and exit with many more.'

This prevents people from creating relationships in a deliberate and intentional way; encourages dependence on couplehood; and discourages community organizing, solidarity, and mutual aid. We will explore other ways to build relationships and how they can progress to building larger communities for support and aid outside of couple-units.'
