description: 'I am a non-binary creator who strives to make art that allows people to express themselves and their interests their way! I mainly focus on art that falls under the "if you know you know" category. To me that means that while a piece may look interesting to everyone, those in a specific community can see that the subject is a certain character or represents a certain identity. I also make art that allows people to openly express their interests, such as their pets or certain pop culture references. All of my art spans several different techniques, sizes, and mediums so that as many people as possible can enjoy what I create regardless of their budget or available decorating space.'
