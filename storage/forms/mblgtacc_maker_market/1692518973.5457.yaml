description: "We are a small press indie queer publisher and art collective, producing both handmade zines and factory-printed books. We have two ongoing zines, The Vineyard and x/y: a junk drawer of trans voices. i was unsure of whether we would be considered a small business or independent creator, as we are not an incorporated business entity and are volunteers. For the Maker's Market, we are interested in presenting a demonstration on how to create, print, and distribute your own zines. Further information about our project can be found here: https://www.dionysianpubliclibrary.com/submissions. My name is vivian thompson, and would be the one tabling for our org. i am a Gender and Women's Studies major at Western Michigan University."
