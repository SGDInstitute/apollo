It often seems like we’ve lost queer politics in lesbian spaces. This lecture seeks to debunk the notion that transness and lesbianness are at odds, and explore radical potentialities of new lesbian spaces! Take a journey through the unexamined genderqueer parts of lesbian history through a trans dyke lens.'

We will discuss loving our bodies and identities because they are fat not in spite of that fact, the history of the fat liberation and body positivity movements, and the intersection of queer and fat identities. This workshop gives fat folks a space to speak, and explores the intersection of fatness and queerness.'

As a gay 15-year-old Olympic bound athlete, I was sexually abused by the adults entrusted in my training. Through this narrative, I will help the audience understand a victim''s perspective of being groomed, the choice of not reporting, and the long-term effects.'

SIU’s LGBTQ Resource Center started as the Gay Student Union in the 1970s. In this workshop, we explain how these two organizations have survived and thrived. We then provide practical ways that similar organizations can tell their stories to effectively and persuasively attain resources and establish partnerships.'
