            text: 'For rural activism that is genuinely effective at creating change, most of the important work happens behind the scenes, long before anyone makes a sign, chants into a megaphone, or chains themself to construction equipment. However, often the skills to do the work are not cultivated- especially at a rural institution. This presentation will provide a basic introduction to organizing meaningful activist actions & organizations within rural universities.'

With that as context, we will offer ideas based in the concept of relationship anarchy on how to create communities that better serve our needs and desires.  Attendees will leave able to recreate and improve their communities.'

Yes it is bright and simple but what does it really mean. Keith Haring an easily recognized artist, but does anyone really know what his art means.  He used bold lines, easy shapes and bright colors to create an easily understandable language without words. His language breaks boundaries to be understood by all from children to old to any language and to any education level.'

Other topics include: letter-writing, professional support, and working “smarter not harder” with small-but-mighty teams. Co-presented with staff from UIowa and Iowa State.'
