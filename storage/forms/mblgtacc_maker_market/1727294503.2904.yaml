description: "I am a 1 person LLC just getting started.  (My sales last year were under $3,000.) My business name is MJW Designs and Things, LLC.  I am a trans activist, photographer, and artist from Marquette and also I will be doing several workshops at MBLGTACC (titled Activism and Becoming an Activist). I would be needing to sell around those time spaces and possibly be set up in close proximity to those locations depending on what time slots I get. I'm not sure how to coordinate all of that. Primarily I would be selling and promoting my flag (the LGBTPOC Spectrum Flag) which I published 2 years ago, and some bumper stickers..... and if there's space, also my 8X10 photos (matted and in sleeves).  My wife will be along to support me both in my vending and in my workshop. We should already be getting tickets through that. I'm really hoping we can make this work."
