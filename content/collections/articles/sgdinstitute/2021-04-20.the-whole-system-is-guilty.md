        text: 'The Institute has been attentive to the trial but even more so to resistance efforts taking place and inspired by impacted communities in Minnesota. We have long understood that taking this killer cop to court would not offer true justice. This verdict still means that systems of policing and imprisonment will be generally unscrutinized by the courts, police departments, or government agencies.'

        text: 'The rhetoric upheld by both the defense and the prosecution is that police are a necessary staple in our communities and a noble profession.

        text: 'The result of this trial is impactful, but not as significant as the ongoing work being orchestrated by those who already know that policing and punishment do not offer us safety. An abolitionist future is made possible because we are already living in an abolitionist present. We don’t need empty promises proffered through legislation that only serve to beef up police power.

While the prosecution wasn’t condemning the institution of police, we are—and our work will continue to be principled and attuned to the vision of justice that refuses to let this manifestation of violence exist.'
