This will ensure consistency in the presentation of information and accomodate for varying levels of access to designers, in turn enabling attendees and other stakeholders to focus on the substance of your bid. Using this 24x36" horizontal poster template, you will create your vision board for what MBLGTACC would like like if it were hosted in your community. Be sure all images are 300dpi and saved in CMYK colorspace, and submit your poster in both .ppt (or .pptx) and .pdf formats. Do not change fonts or colors from the poster template. Consult the first slide in the vision board template for design specifications and other requirements. '
