            text: 'JUSTIN: Our present moment was once a work of fiction, with elements of both fantasy and horror. On one hand, white supremacists disillusioned a future built around the mission of actualizing their self-proclaimed divine right to owning the earth. On the other hand, our ancestors fantasized & mobilized around the undeniable truth that conquest & colonization would not be the main event, and certainly not the end, of their own stories. These contradictory imaginings are dually present in our current moment, and must be acknowledged in all their complex, brutal, violent & vibrant realities to radically change what comes next.'

            text: 'RB: In her keynote address at the Creating Change 2020 Racial Justice Institute last month, Alexis Pauline Gumbs opened by challenging attendees to remain humble… because no one… not a single one of us…. Is an expert on racial justice… or any form of justice for that matter…. because we have never lived in a time where justice has existed. This call to remain humble is an invaluable reminder to us that as we embark on the collective project of envisioning a future together that we cannot depend on individual, idolized people to carry us all to our liberation.'

            text: 'JUSTIN: As we look to the near future, in a few short months our communities will be faced with another significant ripple in our ongoing movement work: a presidential election. While we are wise to pay attention & prepare for this shift, it is also important to find solace & seek guidance from the deeply rooted, under-acknowledged work taking place in our communities every single day. Pandering to electoral politics & placing our reliance on solitary figureheads will not deliver the revolution we are ready for. Any actions that propel us into the next day, and the day after that, that’s the movement.'

It is our turn to not only envision, but act in ways that ensure a world we are already dreaming of:'
