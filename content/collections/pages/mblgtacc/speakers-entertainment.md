She is a queer physically disabled korean transracial and transnational adoptee raised in the Caribbean. She works for community, interdependence and home for all of us, not just some of us, and longs for a world where disabled children can live free of violence, with dignity and love. As her work for liberation evolves and deepens, her roots remain firmly planted in ending sexual violence.'

She is a prison abolitionist and a survivor who believes that we must move beyond punishment, revenge and criminalization if we are ever to effectively break generational cycles of violence and create the world our hearts long for. She is passionate about building the skills, relationships and structures that can transform violence, harm and abuse within our communities and that do not rely on or replicate the punitive system we currently live in. Mia speaks and gives trainings about transformative justice throughout North America.'

Her writings on disability have been used around the world and are a regular part of college and university curricula. Her blog, Leaving Evidence, has become a staple resource for anyone wanting to learn about disability and she has coined language and concepts such as “access intimacy,” “magnificence,” “politically and descriptively disabled” and “forced intimacy.” Mia has played a key role in connecting disability justice with other movements and communities and she has worked tirelessly to educate different communities about disability, ableism, access, disability justice and abled supremacy.'

His passion leads him to wear many hats and have a role in the world as fluid and open as he is. His many roles and hats include working as a Full Spectrum Doula for queer and Trans BIPOC, providing labor support care, abortion advocacy, community defense and Safety task force curator, and a facilitator of all the things Trans, Black, Healing, joyful and challenging! Creating affirming spaces that also foster continuous learning are important factors in Yante’s work, as the fight to decolonize, stripe white supremacy from our communities, and love radically stand at the forefront of his work and life.'

            text: "Saint Saunter (aka Sarah Akawa) (she/her) spins a mix of genres from club, pop/mainstream, house, and solid throwbacks. Much more than a DJ, Saint Saunter is creator of Madison's favorite queer multi-genre festival Hot Summer Gays alongside Dyke Dive. She has been creating queer nightlife spaces since her early days in Madison at the now defunct Plan B in collaboration with Tina She of The-L-Word-famous hip hop duo, God-des & She. After She Said Parties ended, Saint then created her long standing series QueerIRL which has held art pop ups, slow jam nights, and other events. Saint Saunter can also be found spinning at Dyke Dive, Madison-based house group JAMS, Madison and other Midwest PrideFests, and various local Madison venues. Seemingly oddly, Saint Saunter’s start in music comes from emo / pop punk music. She began her career as a promoter as a young teenager throwing shows for other teens, primarily booking emo bands in her hometown of Stevens Point, Wisconsin. That makes more sense when you find out that her side and passion project is Emo Nite Madison and Pop Punk Pizza Party; nights that celebrate her root love of emo and pop punk music. As a queer Asian woman in a white /cis / male dominated field she has delighted in mentoring other people of color and queer DJs, “I feel like it has been a huge gift to share my love of DJing and nightlife with the community and helping to uplift more queer and POC DJs around Madison”.\_\_Recently, Saint Saunter has joined Milwaukee’s No Stress Collective, which is a party collective of DJs, party planners, photographers, creating amazing dance parties for people who love to dance. Their motto is “Always Fun. No Hate, No Ego, No Stress”. Ultimately, Saint Saunter says its all about the community and friends that are made at her parties, “None of this would be worth anything without the people who come out, sweat, dance, meet new and old friends, and have fun. The community we create depends on every single person who comes through the door, and it makes it all worth it.” Whatever the night, genre, or location, Saint Saunter is always bringing together the queer community for dancing, fun, expression, and to celebrate the queer community. Lastly, Saint Saunter encourages those who are seeking to make a space that is needed to reach out to her: “I’m a huge collaborator, nothing is worth doing without friends alongside you.”"

Broderick also is a medical research associate with the Medical College of Wisconsin’s Center for AIDS Intervention Research.  He has been a strong advocate for equality and improvements within healthcare systems for marginalized populations over the last 10+ years through the research he currently does.  Broderick, also being the Community Chair for the Wisconsin’s HIV State Action Planning group, uses his knowledge, connection, relatability and trust with the Black LGBT community to help bridge the gap between healthcare disparities and self-empowerment both professionally and personally.  Broderick attributes the House of Infiniti as his foundation towards community outreach, awareness, education and prevention.  Being part of a non-profit organization made up by same gender loving black men provided tools and resources that are still utilized today within his life on a professional aspect and within his personal connections he carries for the community.'
