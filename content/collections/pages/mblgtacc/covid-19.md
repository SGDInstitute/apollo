            text: 'A: We’re very optimistic that our base case will include a robust in-person experience with a layered public health context, and—for the first time ever—we''re also offering a digital layer to the conference. As the pandemic has taught everyone, we cannot guarantee that the timing or format of an in-person event will not change due to sudden or emerging circumstances that occur between now and conference weekend. As always, we will continue to be informed in our current and future decisions by the recommendations of medical and public health experts, and guided by the Institute''s core values of accessibility, community, advocacy, education, accountability, and liberation.'

            text: ' is the single-most effective means of protecting oneself and preventing severe illness and death from the disease. The MBLGTACC 2021 planning team and the Institute give our highest and most emphatic recommendation that people attending in person be fully vaccinated unless advised otherwise by their doctor. We are very encouraged by the reality that so many MBLGTACC attendees come from institutions and communities already covered by vaccine requirements, including our hosts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We will expect all attendees to wear masks and follow common social distancing measures in indoor conference spaces. We also ask and encourage all those who are joining us to carry those practices into other establishments they enter while visiting.'
