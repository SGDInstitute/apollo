description: 'Campus Pride is a national nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization “for” and “by” student leaders working to improve college environments for LGBTQIA+ students. Our objective is to develop necessary resources to support and empower LGBTQIA+ students to create colleges and universities free of prejudice, bigotry and hate. Just some of our key programs/resources include the Campus Pride Index- a database of colleges and universities indicating which support services they offer for LGBTQIA+ students; Camp Pride- the nation’s first summer leadership academy for LGBTQIA+ students; Social Justice “Mini-Grants” and Internship opportunities for college students; Career Connect- a platform for students and graduates to find LGBTQIA+ friendly mentors and job opportunities; and Safe Space Training for faculty, administrators, and staff. As we begin to re-launch our college fair program, MBLGTACC is a perfect opportunity for us to connect with student leaders and educate attendees about our resources and internship opportunities.'
