We embrace the idea that it is not only possible, but it is happening. Everyday. On our college campuses, in our student organizations, and in our surrounding communities. We are bringing our desks to the ground and our work to our classrooms to make sure the Midwest is pushing for our collective liberation. For all of its intricacies and challenges, we are proud to call the Midwest home.'

The Midwest was overlooked.'

            text: ': Annexed from the work happening on the coasts by geography and resources, Midwestern student leaders and activists took it upon themselves to create their own change. They launched MBLGTACC. This weekend marks the 26th time that queer and trans+ students from across the Midwest—and the nation—have come together for a weekend of learning and coalition building. Our gathering this weekend comes at a time when fear and pain is rampant and our attention is drawn in many confusing directions as we try to monitor the next attack on our identities, our bodies, our lives. This fear and pain exists within our own community and in the communities of other systemically disenfranchised groups. It is profoundly disheartening that in the year 2018, we still must fight external forces for our basic rights and liberation. But our community is strong. We are resilient. We are powerful and revolutionary.'

We must learn to not only confront oppression, but to dismantle systemic institutions including white supremacy, ableism, colonialism, xenophobia, the police and surveillance state, and ALL mechanisms of social control that threaten our ability to be. We cannot be complicit in the oppression of others because that means we are complicit in the oppression of ourselves. We must build our collective power and we must resist.'
