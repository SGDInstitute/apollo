Prior to Covid, she was often working with amazing clients who celebrated Jade for her positive attitude, friendliness, and guidance in all things cosmetic related. On December 16, 2020, Jade became a victim of gun violence from a client and almost died. During her intensive rehabilitation where she underwent four different major reconstructive surgeries within three months to save her life, Jade became very familiar with the medical system and realized she wanted to go into healthcare so she too may be able to help others that have gone through similar experiences as herself. She is proud to share that recently, she enrolled in college and is pursuing a Bachelors of Nursing. Jade is excited to be part of this summit, to lend her voice and experience to help raise awareness to the violence that many trans women of color experience.'
