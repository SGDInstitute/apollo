description: 'Iâ€™m an artist and musician making art and music about my experience as a trans and queer man, relationships with home and place and how those relationships play into identity, and exploring moments of daily magic often through high contrast visual pieces (ink on paper, paint, printmaking, zines) as well as intimate and almost journalistic songs.'
