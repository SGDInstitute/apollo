description: "Campus Pride represents the leading national nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization for student leaders and campus groups working to create a safer college environment for LGBTQ students. The organization is a volunteer-driven network “for” and “by” student leaders.\r\n\r\nI am a current student leader who is representing Campus Pride  as a volunteer by having an exhibit table. I also hope to attend the conference as a student leader at Campus Pride.  I am not sure if I need another pass to do that?  Please advise so we can pay for a table and for me to learn/interact with other student leaders."
