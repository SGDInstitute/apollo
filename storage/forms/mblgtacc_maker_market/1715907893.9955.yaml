description: "I make saucy + sardonic buttons, often with queer and trans themes. You can check some of them out at www.facebook.com/JJButtonFactory/.   I and my partner took part as vendors/markers in the 2021 MBLGTACC market when it was in Madison, and it was such a positive experience I'd love to repeat it."

proposed_fee: "I believe I could contribute $100 in fees. Unfortunately buttons aren't a huge money maker, so that is what I think I could offer."
