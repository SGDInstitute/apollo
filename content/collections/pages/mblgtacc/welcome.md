            text: "These community welcomes serve as acknowledgements of our vast community to ensure we are centering subcommunities less visible or afforded less agency in the mainstream efforts for queer and trans liberation, bodily and sexual autonomy, and gender justice. These acknowledgements have been drafted by members of the Midwest Institute for Sexuality and Gender Diversity, in collaboration with conference partners. We fully recognize this is not an exhaustive list and welcome recommendations for future community acknowledgements to continue honoring the beauty of our expansive collective. We fully subscribe to the notion that you cannot implore people to show up in their fullness if you only build space for a fraction of who they are, and this is one way we have opted to identify the intersections of our greater community.\_"

We understand that the history of colonial conquest and occupation of this land impacts our current conditions. We offer an intervention of this U.S.-based space and articulate our commitment to supporting decolonial efforts. We also offer immense thanks to the continued labour of the Water Protectors who continue to defend the Earth we share.'

We defend these communities as legitimate identities and encourage questioning the notion that sexual and romantic relationships are inherently good for all people. Along with the recent change to the conference name interpretation, we will continue to address the ways asexual and aromantic experiences overlap and intersect with queer experiences.\_ Ace and Aro erasure are incredibly common and we hope to utilize our platform to ensure that we are highlighting these communities as well as continue education and advocacy that is ace/aro inclusive.

We advocate for continued adjustments to our language, physical spaces and processes that better center the various needs of these communities & encouragement investment in greater accessibility to ensure all members of our larger community are able to participate fully in gatherings, movement actions & institutions of education.\_"

We aim to center these communities in our shared spaces, including intentional designation of gender inclusive restrooms throughout the conference space, incorporating pronouns onto the conference badges and encouraging attendees to also defer to these voices in shared space whenever possible. We do not condone the pathologization or expectation of medical interventions to validate trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming, and intersex people. We support the bodily autonomy and self-determination of these communities to pursue and express their gender in ways most affirming for them.\_"

We especially recognize both faith and faithless narratives that are commonly erased or dismissed. We reject Christian hegemony. We oppose anti-Muslim sentiments. We oppose anti-Semitism. We embrace faith practices that are not Western in origin, and those that are not of the Abrahamic tradition. We recognize and uplift indigenous faith practices from across the world. We promote and celebrate the ability for people to reject or redefine spirituality through atheism or agnosticism. We also recognize the history of harm enacted on queer and trans people through institutionalized religion and honor that attendees may hold pain as an outcome of their relationship with religion/faith/spirituality.\_"

We would like to uplift and support our attendees that are in polyamorous relationships and part of the polyam community.\_"

We value the practice of group empowerment, and encourage the understanding that consent, trust and communication is vital; mental and physical health are of utmost consideration before, during, and after kink and fetish acts; and acts such as bondage and wax play, among others, are not inherently sexual in nature. We echo advocacy for risk-aware consensual kink and continued efforts to build empowering spaces for students to explore themselves and their playmates. With these spaces comes the necessary education of consent, and safety procedures in order to enjoy kink and leather. We advocate that attendees see that kink lifestyles are rooted in respect, affection, trust, and healthy enjoyment of the mind and body.'
