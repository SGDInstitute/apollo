Though firearm laws in Ohio permit open carry and licensed concealed carry, no firearms or weapons will be permitted on Greater Columbus Convention Center property. Per GCCC policy: "The carrying of firearms and/or other weapons of any kind within the facility is limited to “officers of the law” unless prior written approval is attained from Greater Columbus Convention Center Management," such as for a hypothetical firearm convention. (There are no firearm conventions scheduled on or around the time of MBLGTACC.) '

The law does not regulate smoking outdoors unless smoke is entering a regulated area or smoking is occurring on an outdoor patio that does not meet the criteria to permit smoking. The smoking law gives a proprietor the right to declare outside areas as non-smoking areas or for local municipalities to enact laws that are more stringent than the Ohio Smoke-Free Workplace Act. '
