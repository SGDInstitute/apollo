            text: 'Each year, the University of Findlay puts on a drag show on campus. Being a campus founded in faith with strong Christian undertones, there is often backlash and naysayers who cannot believe that the administration would allow this to occur on school property. However, over the last ten years, Findlay has become a more welcoming and supportive environment for the LGBTQ+ community, and the drag show is certainly an aspect of that. The community support we receive for this show is amazing, and we want to share how we do it with other schools that may be interested in pursuing that same kind of acceptance and support from their college towns.'

It often seems like we’ve lost queer politics in lesbian spaces. This lecture seeks to debunk the notion that transness and lesbianness are at odds, and explore radical potentialities of new lesbian spaces! Take a journey through the unexamined genderqueer parts of lesbian history through a trans dyke lens.\_ "

This workshop gives fat folks a space to speak, and explores the intersection of fatness and queerness.'

            text: 'Often, life feels like a railroad and we’re the train stuck on those tracks. While Queer people have always been at the forefront of making our own way, we are not invincible to getting stuck. Sometimes, we don’t even know we’re on rails until someone shows us the switchboard. Come hear about a ten year gap year (!!), options besides going to graduate school/starting a career, what being a trans adult can look like, and how to jump the tracks. With time for questions.'

Those with or without SUDs welcome to join!'
