            text: 'College campuses are key areas of influence for our conference attendees. The history of higher education is rife with instances in which queer and trans people are underrepresented in programming, initiatives, and opportunities. College students, educators, and practitioners play an integral role in expanding possibilities for our communities on campuses and improving campus climate for marginalized people.'

We will explore strategies that help LGBTQ+ people better understand themselves and others in efforts to cultivate collective advocacy to embody Adam Eli’s call that “queer people anywhere are responsible for queer people everywhere”. The workshop will include resilience cultivation strategies and provide findings from the implementation of the LGBTQ+ Empowerment Workshop Series.'

            text: 'While bathroom accessibility on college campuses is a necessity for all students, trans students are disproportionately affected due to the lack of gender-neutral bathrooms that are available. This workshop will help students and organizations understand the importance of gender-neutral bathrooms, from signage, sanitary products, and accessibility while also cultivate advocacy skills through the process of working with their college to create a more trans-friendly environment on campus.'

This workshop aims to provide resources that center queer students to have an empowering experience in the classroom from Queer instructors with various backgrounds. Finally, we will invite attendees to share their narratives and strategies to cultivate a safe classroom environment.'
