        text: 'Our work is rooted in and inspired by the fight and efforts of those before us. The queer activism of the future stands upon that history—and in our shared values and goals—but it is our actions today that shape where we go from here. We know that when we work together, when we center the needs of the most marginalized, when we fight—relentlessly and strategically—for justice, our potential for positive change is limitless. Our theme is, at once, an aspirational vision and a mirror. It''s a vision of what can be if we do what we can, where we can, as often as we can. And it requires us to reflect on where we are now, and what we stand to lose. The queer activism of the future starts now.'
