  This Pride Month, Colectivo Coffee has chosen to support the work of the Institute by pledging to us $1 from the sale of every one-pound bag of their special-edition Pride Blend. Fellow Midwesterners, Colectivo was established in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1993.

  "We celebrate Pride Month – and the ongoing work to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity / expression – with this special edition coffee," Colectivo shared online. "This sweet and balanced combination of coffees from Mexico and Costa Rica offers notes of dried cranberry, caramel apple, and cinnamon and shines a light on the progress being made in these and other Latin American origins toward marriage equality."
