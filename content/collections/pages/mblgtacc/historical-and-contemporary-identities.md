            text: 'These days, “lesbian” is a dying identity: non-heterosexual women have started identifying in other ways, and we lesbians have had a troubling history with the trans community. It often seems like we’ve lost queer politics in lesbian spaces. This lecture seeks to debunk the notion that transness and lesbianness are at odds, and explore radical potentialities of new lesbian spaces! Take a journey through the unexamined genderqueer parts of lesbian history through a trans dyke lens.'

            text: 'Stone identity is as rich and complex as it is misunderstood band oversimplified. Unlike the term implies, stone identity is a place for warmth, growth, and physical fulfillment. Stone identities have existed for decades, and while research suggests that the number of stone people has remained relatively constant, the identity has seen a resurgence in popular queer culture. Delve into the history and politics of this complex sexual and emotional identity! This workshop is 18+.'

As a community, we must learn from our history and we simply cannot do that without delving first into butch/femme identities across the gender spectrum. In this session, we will discuss the coevolution of butch and femme identity and community, the backlash against and erasure of these identities, and the resilience of the communities in the present day.'

The wide world of identity can be intimidating to navigate, especially for folks exploring their identities and attempting to find community. All too often our history can be inaccessible, or worse, inaccurate causing misunderstandings, frustration, and community turmoil. TERF Wars dives into the many facets of sapphic sexuality, gender, and orientation, to help you figure out what the L is going on.'
