summary: 'We revisit our 2022 Transgender Justice Teach-In where panelists Merrique Jenson, Codi Charles, Romeo Jackson and Bishop Howard discuss building liberated futures with queer and trans youth. In a moment where we’ve experienced an endless barrage of anti-trans attacks that deeply affect young trans people, the key messages from this conversation are just as true today as they were a year ago. What do we mean by “youth” and who is afforded the space to be young? What rights do children have and how do we exist in right relationship with trans youth? All these questions are covered on this episode of Take the Last Bite.'
