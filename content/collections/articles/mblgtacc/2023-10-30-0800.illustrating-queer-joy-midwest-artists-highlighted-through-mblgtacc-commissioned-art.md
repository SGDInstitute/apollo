        text: 'Turner, of Clarkston, Michigan, is a 2023 graduate of the University of Michigan''s Penny Stamps School of Art and Design. He drew inspiration for his piece from queer elders. "Their pain resulted in a society where I can exist freely," Turner said. "I imagined a couple embracing one another with a love so strong that they became a tree. Their wide-reaching canopy can provide shade and comfort to anyone who may pass by, assisting couples who too plant their seed in the same grove. The implication is that though these people may have passed away, their love will live on and make the lives of others that much easier. Through perseverance, we can all achieve a sense of belonging and self-actualization when connected to our community." '

"It''s about finding a community that listens, speaks out, and understands. Queer joy is everywhere, but only if you know how to find it."'

        text: 'Both were interested in art at an early age. Passos, in her submission to the selection committee, wrote,  "I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil." And Turner said his earliest memories of gravitating toward art came when he was in preschool—"I was anxious to talk to the other children, and drawing was a good excuse to be in your own world and express your thoughts. The act of artmaking was eventually something I could use to connect with others."'
