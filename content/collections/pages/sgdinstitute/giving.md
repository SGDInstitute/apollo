            text: 'Often referred to as “fly over states,” the Midwest is forgotten and underfunded. The crucial work of the region is often left out of national rhetoric and communities within the region are subjected to stretching limited resources. Queer and trans youth in the Midwest are more likely to experience “biased language, victimization, and anti-LGBTQ discriminatory school policies and practices” than in the Northeast or West (Kosciw et al, 2018).'

A sense of belonging leads to “higher levels of queer-spectrum student academic success” (Garvey et al, 2018). The social relationships and support built at the conference plays an important protective role in reducing hopelessness and anxiety; “as hopelessness is important in predicting suicidal behavior, peer and significant-other social support may be targets for intervention to decrease LGBT suicidality” (McConnell et al, 2015).'

Conservative foundations have invested far more in think tanks and idea generation, while liberal foundations have focused almost exclusively on direct service work. “Although large liberal foundations have far more assets than conservative foundations, the latter have been so successful because they have been strategic. [...] Their ideological platform now shapes public policy and debate today.” (Ahn, 2007).'
