We carve out space, we map out pathways, and we seek to replenish the joy that is so frequently stolen from us through legislative attacks, structural erasure, and interpersonal harms. '

Our power lies in our capacity to hold joy, share joy, and reject the idea that we are only meant to struggle. Thank you for taking the time to join us at this year’s conference and may your MBLGTACC 2023 be an enjoyable experience. '

These acknowledgements have been drafted by members of the Midwest Institute for Sexuality and Gender Diversity, in collaboration with conference partners. We fully recognize this is not an exhaustive list and welcome recommendations for future community acknowledgements to continue honoring the beauty of our expansive collective. We fully subscribe to the notion that you cannot implore people to show up in their fullness if you only build space for a fraction of who they are, and this is one way we have opted to identify the intersections of our greater community.\_"

We value the practice of group empowerment, and encourage the understanding that consent, trust and communication is vital; mental and physical health are of utmost consideration before, during, and after kink and fetish acts; and acts such as bondage and wax play, among others, are not inherently sexual in nature. We echo advocacy for risk-aware consensual kink and continued efforts to build empowering spaces for students to explore themselves and their playmates. With these spaces comes the necessary education of consent, and safety procedures in order to enjoy kink and leather. We advocate that attendees see that kink lifestyles are rooted in respect, affection, trust, and healthy enjoyment of the mind and body.'
