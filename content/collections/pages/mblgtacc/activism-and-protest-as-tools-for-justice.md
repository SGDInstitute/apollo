            text: 'Justice and rights will never be handed over by oppressive systems. They must be demanded. College campuses, urban centers, and rural communities have all been sites for direct action, protests, and other forms of activism in recent years specifically around issues of racial justice, police brutality, student loan debt, and climate catastrophes. Queer and trans folks are highly represented among those on the front lines, in medic tents, and leading mutual aid projects.'

            text: 'Mainstream culture defines “beautiful” and “healthy” as “thin, ” and while our community has often subverted this notion, fatphobia is prevalent. We will discuss loving our bodies and identities because they are fat not in spite of that fact, the history of the fat liberation and body positivity movements, and the intersection of queer and fat identities. This workshop gives fat folks a space to speak, and explores the intersection of fatness and queerness.'

In this session, we will explore how structures like white supremacy and ableism inform our notions about who has voices worth valuing and what can be done to tread the path of liberation together.'

This workshop addresses what pinkwashing is and where it came from, what organizations engage in pinkwashing, myths about LGBTQ Israel and Palestine, exposing the Islamophobia industry''s role in pinkwashing, and how queer and trans people can fight back in their communities.'

            text: 'This combination of a workshop and storytelling focuses on the elements and obstacles of professional activism outside of the non-profit industrial complex, drawn from a 20 year career of a freelance organizer, trainer, and founder of multiple sustained initiatives. It will discuss the intricacies of finding our people, building grassroots resources, and navigating multi-community dynamics inherent to Midwestern (and other politically conservative) environments in the face of poverty, isolation, and self-preservation.'
