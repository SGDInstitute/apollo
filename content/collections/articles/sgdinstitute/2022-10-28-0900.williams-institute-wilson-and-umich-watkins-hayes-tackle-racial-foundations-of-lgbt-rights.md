        text: 'When asked, based on her research and experience, about what the overall social and cultural conversation is missing or getting wrong around public policy and LGBT rights, Wilson said, "When we think about what kind of bills and protections are at play now or on the horizon that are specific to sexual orientation and gender identity, like the Equality Act or efforts to protect the rights of trans-youth and trans people to receive gender affirming care, it''s not that that''s getting it wrong." She continued, "It''s that the data on disparities and lived experiences of LGBTQ people clearly should be driving how we frame what it means to be an LGBT rights issue. It should be driving us to broaden that." And for a number of issues—poverty, food insecurity, and homelessness in particular—she says that while sexual orientation and gender identity specific anti-discrimination protections are important foundations, they "aren''t gonna do it alone." "That really should be leading us to think about what are the policies that will improve economic well-being of neighborhoods overall," she added.'

Spend some time finding someone who is doing something that excites you, then ask them how they got there. You are likely to find out that for every three to five people that you find that you like the work that they are doing, that they got there in different ways, so it opens up multiple paths to getting to that work."'
