Tracks help shape the workshop content and aid attendees in choosing which workshops to attend based on their interests, area of focus or future plans. Think of tracks like seasons of a TV show or podcast, there is a basic premise tying everything together but each episode covers something different or builds off of what happened in a previous episode.'
