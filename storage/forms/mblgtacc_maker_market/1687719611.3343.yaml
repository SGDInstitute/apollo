description: "Hi! My name is Fern, and I'm a non-binary lesbian artist based in St Louis, MO. I create work that centers queerness and is inspired by the relationship between queer folks and nature. I create fine art prints, zines, washi tape, shirts, bandanas, stationery, and more. You can see my work at liketheplant.com or on my Instagram @fern_werm. :)"
