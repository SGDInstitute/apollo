description: "I am a queer photographer, drag artist, and tinkerer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. My photographs depict the mind in turmoil driven by Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and my wares include self-portrait zines exploring the fluidity of my identity, photography prints, earrings, plushies, crochet mushroom ornaments, and psychedelic phone grips.\r\n\r\nI collaborate frequently with my identical twin, K Britton of Queerdo Co., who I would love to table next to if possible."
