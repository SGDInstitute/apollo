        text: 'We take (another) bite out of the trans policy issues surrounding anti-trans legislation targeting participation in sports. We’ve pulled the audio from our Queer Policy event from July 2021 for this special episode as we continue to monitor the impact of these policies in current time. This discussion between Katie Barnes, ESPN feature writer; Chris Mosier, Olympic Trials athlete and founder of TransAthlete.com; and Naomi Goldberg, deputy director and LGBTQ program director at the Movement Advancement Project makes important connections between the larger movement for trans justice and what’s happening in the world of professional, collegiate and K-12 sports. The event was hosted in partnership with the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.'

It's a direct counter to the Midwest Nice mentality— highlighting advocacy and activism by queer/trans communities in the Midwest region. Through each episode, we're aiming to unearth the often disregarded and unacknowledged contributions of queer and trans folks to social change through interviews, casual conversations and reflections on Midwest queer time, space, and place.\_"
