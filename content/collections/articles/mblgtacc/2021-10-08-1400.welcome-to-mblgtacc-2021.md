        text: "As queer and trans people, we are accustomed to building, bettering and banding together in complex and dire circumstances. We have persevered through many historical plights such as 1960s era laws criminalizing our attire and sexual activities and the devastating impacts of the AIDS epidemic.

We need others to carry the torch when it is time for our own bodies to rest."
