description: 'Meadville Lombard Theological School is a Unitarian Universalist graduate school in downtown Chicago that prepares progressive social justice leaders of the future.  With a pluralistic and inclusive spirit, the school is seeking new opportunities for exposure to queer students who might be considering spiritual and social justice leadership in their communities.  We would like to have two admissions representatives set up at a table to speak to students about Meadville Lombard''s graduate, doctorate, and continuing education opportunities.  We are considered a "small seminary" so we are aligning with the small business suggested donation of $550 for two days.  Thank you for hosting such an important conference!'
