        text: 'An estimated 15-26 million people took to the streets this summer in what became the largest wave of protest in U.S. history. Amid the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and racism, and sparked by the police killings of Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Rayshard Brooks, millions are looking closely—many for the first time—at the plague of state-sanctioned violence that has terrorized and defined our communities for centuries. At a time of great potential for transformational change, neglecting to center trans, nonbinary, and intersex knowledge, experiences, and liberation is a choice that limits that change.'
