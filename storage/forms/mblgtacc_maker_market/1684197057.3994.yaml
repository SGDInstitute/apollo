description: 'My art business is called Hot Girl Farmer; a feminist sticker shop oriented around empowering women and marginalized groups. I created my cheeky, farm-inspired art collection after Roe overturned to raise money for the ACLU. The goal of my art/sticker collection is to raise awareness around reproductive rights for those with a uterus. I create my designs to be eye-catching and inspire conversation around civil rights.
