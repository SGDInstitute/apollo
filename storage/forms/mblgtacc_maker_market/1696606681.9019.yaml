description: "Everyone deserves a place to discover something new. Lexington Public Library stands for free and open access to information. We’re a safe, welcoming space for neighbors to come together — opening the door so all Lexingtonians can find what they’re looking for.\r\n\r\nWe would love to come to the vendor fair to connect with folks and share cool swag information about the library!"
