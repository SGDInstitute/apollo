As planners of previous conferences, we are highly aware of the challenges that are faced by each planning team. Planning this conference requires two years of dedication. Each year, students from the host school must build a team and figure out how to make this weekend happen. When we created our teams and planned our respective conferences, we started from scratch. There was no manual to follow, and certainly no organization to share knowledge about what worked well in the past and what didn’t work so well.'

            text: "From the very beginning it has been recognized that the Midwest has not been given due credit for its participation and continual contributions to social justice efforts, including queer \_and trans justice. This space has been vital for attendees and planners alike to ensure that a continued space is created for our larger community as well as making a statement each year that the Midwest is just as invested in the movement as our coastal counterparts and greater urban areas. We are elated to say we have been hard at work making strides so that not only can we continue providing this space but also amplifying the voices and validity of Midwest queer and trans experiences beyond the three day weekend."

We re-envision an educational climate that centers the needs and experiences of systemically disadvantaged students and affirms and encourages sexuality and gender diversity. Our mission is to empower students of diverse sexualities and genders to inspire sustainable change; lead higher education colleagues in relevant and inclusive practices; and advance knowledge of sexuality and gender through advocacy and expansive programming.'

We cannot and will not justify building an organization that exists to support the privileged few. Here today, we re-commit to uplifting the voices of those in our community who are so often not heard.'

It has also been our self-proclaimed duty to deliberate on how these larger issues impacting our nation inherently and uniquely impact the Midwest region. We would like to invite you to our State of the Region panel on Saturday morning starting at 10:20 am in room 313 to hear some our teammates discuss their experiences with the Midwest and some of the major issues currently facing our community. We would greatly value your attendance and feedback on what you think we should focus our efforts on as we continue to grow this organization.'
