description: 'We take a bite out of queer and trans affirming healthcare with Asher Wickell (they/he) a family & marriage therapist based in Wichita, KS. We get philosophical in our exploration of what healing looks like in the face of perpetual harm, how the pandemic has unearthed realizations about the flaws in our healthcare systems, and what a future of affirming care could look like when the current system becomes obsolete.'
