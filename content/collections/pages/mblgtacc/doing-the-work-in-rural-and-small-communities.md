            text: 'Rural and/or small communities are a major focus of this year’s conference to honor the LGBTQ+ communities who exist in these complex campus and community spaces. Communities outside of urban spaces are often disregarded by political campaigning and resource allocation, leaving marginalized communities to manifest their own models of advocacy, organizing, and activism. By focusing on the work being done in rural communities to bridge resource gaps, build extensive communities, and combat small town conservative ideologies, we expand our toolkit of possible tactics and strategies for social change.'

SIU’s LGBTQ Resource Center started as the Gay Student Union in the 1970s. In this workshop, we explain how these two organizations have survived and thrived. We then provide practical ways that similar organizations can tell their stories to effectively and persuasively attain resources and establish partnerships.'

This workshop would be best for anyone who is starting their journey of learning LGBTQ+ histories and/or has an interest in documenting LGBTQ+ history, whether that be for your larger community or your school’s LGBTQ+ organization.'

The majority of us live in the “fly over zone;” Central, Midwestern, and Southern states where we are consistently isolated from resources and each other. Living in culturally conservative areas has a significant impact on forming relationships, attending work and school, and navigating self-care. This workshop discusses the varying avenues community building found within our struggle and resilience.'

Even with how inclusive our communities, media, social movements, and spaces can be, there is much work to do. Trans people endure inequalities, civil rights violations, and violence because of ignorance, fear, and prejudice toward their identities even from other LGBTQ+ people. When we recognize and confront these inequalities we make safer, more inclusive spaces for trans people to exist in.'
