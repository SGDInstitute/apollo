        text: 'is an attorney at Varnum. Born and raised in the Flint, Michigan area, Matt completed his bachelor of arts degree in film and video studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. After graduating, he managed projects in the film programming department at Outfest—Los Angeles’ LGBT film festival—and later worked for Sundance Institute and Sundance Film Festival, where he managed public programming initiatives. In 2008, Matt returned to Ann Arbor to pursue his juris doctor degree at the University of Michigan Law School. During that time, he interned for the Triangle Foundation (now Equality Michigan)—a Detroit-based LGBT advocacy organization—in its Victim Services department, supporting LGBT victims of hate and bias crimes. After receiving his law degree, Matt moved back to Los Angeles to work in the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office, and later at Bergman Dacey Goldsmith, an LA-based litigation firm. Matt came home to Michigan in 2014, joining Varnum''s trial group in Grand Rapids, where he practices general commercial and real estate litigation, some family law, and maintains an active pro bono practice.'

        text: "\_is a system administrator at Netsmart Technologies. Born in Lawrence, Kansas, Bryan is the child of a black mother from inner city Kansas City and a white father from 300 acres of rural farmland—parents they saw fight hard for the acceptance and opportunities of their kids. Bryan spent the mid-90s in suburban Ohio and entered college at the age of 20. At Kent State University, they became involved with Delta Lambda Phi—the nation’s oldest and largest fraternity for gay, bisexual, and progressive men—and began their commitment to service. Bryan graduated from Kent State with a bachelor of fine arts in musical theatre, later producing a benefit for GLSEN at the New York Theatre, performing on a cruise around the world, and continuing to serve DLP in various roles. Today, Bryan is the president of DLP’s alumni association. They also serve as a board member— previously diversity and inclusion coordinator—of the Women’s A Cappella Association. Through that work, they’re heavily involved in the a cappella community and teach high school and college students how to share their stories and connect with other people authentically and truthfully through music and performance. As system administrator for Netsmart Technologies, Bryan works to enable healthcare organizations across the United States to provide high-quality behavioral health care through innovative technology and human solutions. In their free time, Bryan enjoys science fiction and fantasy epics of all kinds—tv, movies, and books—and loves to travel."
