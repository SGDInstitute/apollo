        text: '," the Institute''s R.B. Brooks led the trio of panelists in talking about the unique positions of fat/plus size trans people to unearth lessons about desire, wellness, design, language, love, and so much more. In what ways can fatness and gender come together to shape our lives? What lessons have been revealed in the current moment? What does it look like to move beyond self-love and into a liberated future? Morton, Higgins, and Smoore offered stories about their lived experiences, observations of health and beauty practices that inhibit our livelihoods, and ways fat/plus size trans folks are (re)claiming agency over their bodies.'
