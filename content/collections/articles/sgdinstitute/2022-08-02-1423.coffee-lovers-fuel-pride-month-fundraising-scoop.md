  It's the Institute's largest-ever single donation. During Pride Month this year, Midwest-based Colectivo Coffee chose to support the work of the Midwest Institute for Sexuality and Gender Diversity by pledging to us $1 from the sale of every one-pound bag of theirÂ special-edition Pride Blend. 

  The outcome? Friends, Colectivo regulars, and coffee-loving CNET readers across America turned out in huge number, yielding a total donation of $7,596.90 for the Institute.
