description: "Kat Smith is a queer multi-media artist living in Lexington, KY. Their work intersects between fibers, print, and zines, often melding these mediums together. Their creative practice draws on themes of nature, ritual, mysticism, and justice work, with their process serving as a meditative act. Kat is also really passionate about vibrant community building, herbal medicine, and losing it on the dance floor! You can find their work on instagram @material.drifter.\r\n\r\nAs a queer and nonbinary artist, getting to vend at an event specifically highlighting queer and trans creatives is very exciting! Additionally, a lot of my art focuses on my relationship with nature, which, is inextricable tied to my queer experience."
