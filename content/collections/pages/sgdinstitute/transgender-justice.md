            text: 'From the illustrious southside of Chicago and grandchild of the incomparable Gracie Lee Fowler, Romeo Jackson (they/them) is a first generation Black college graduate, queer, non-binary femme scholar. Romeo is also a descendent of the estimated 11 million Black Africans who were kidnapped and held in captivity which resulted in their enslavement.  They are a feminist dedicated to intersectional justice and cross movement building. Currently, Romeo is the political education coordinator for BYP100. Their research, writing, and practice explores  race/ism, anti-Blackness, and settler colonialism within a higher education context with an emphasis on the experiences of queer and trans students of color. Romeo is committed to uplifting and empowering queer and trans people of color through a Black queer feminist lens. Grounded and guided by the ancestral power that transcends the grave Romeo thanks Gracie Lee Fowler and Audre Lorde for keeping them committed to their whole-self and making sure they are not tokenized for their identities in a world committed to stealing their knowledge and essence for the advancement of white supremacy.'
