description: 'I am a queer artist who creates handcrafted tallow based soap in Marquette, MI. I render down locally sourced suet into tallow, and create stunning and vibrant bars of soap. This product aligns with the intentions of the market, as it is supporting a queer college student''s self expression through soap art and recognizing the overlap of LGBTQ+ and rural/homesteading communities. I create different lines of soap that tell stories of liberation, operating with the mantra "Wash your hands & free your mind!" Thank you for your time and consideration!'
