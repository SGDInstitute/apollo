            text: 'Historical concepts of identity are essential to how we understand our community and ourselves and all too often our history can be inaccessible, or worse, inaccurate causing misunderstandings, frustration, and community turmoil. During sessions in this track you will learn about sapphic history from the 19th century through today. Presenters will delve into discussions of personal and community identity development and explore the implications of homophobia, transphobia, racism, and fatphobia on the words we use and the way we structure our lives.'
