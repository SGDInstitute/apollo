        text: '2022 was a milestone year for America’s largest and longest continuously-running conference for LGBTQIA+ college students and young adults, and so our needs for and expectation of our major creative works were as high as ever. Over three decades, tens of thousands have gathered at MBLGTACC—the Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender Asexual College Conference—to learn and grow through the knowledge and experience of their peers and experts. And, in addition to celebrating the event’s legacy and impact, planners looked into the conference’s fourth decade by introducing the brand new Maker Market and Revoluncheon; reintroducing workshop tracks; creating a reusable signage system for the benefit of future conferences; hosting timely, relevant keynotes from Schuyler Bailar and Imani Barbarin; and more.

        text: 'On the creative side, some co-existing priorities our team considered were the specialness of the occasion; varying tones, audiences, and levels of emphasis among some pieces; and conference and Institute brand standards. Continuing a trend of increasing alignment with the Institute brand, creative makes heavy use of the organization’s brand colors, fonts, and overall design sensibilities, while carving out its own clear and unique space through the use of three- and two-color gradients, new design motifs, commissioned art, and a special thirtieth anniversary affinity graphic that appeared on nearly a hundred unique branded pieces.

Registration and the workshop RFP were a priority of these first waves of communication.'

        text: "The Maker Market was a new program for 2022, elevating queer and trans makers in the conference space. Our team thought of this space as a queer, in-person, Etsy-like shop and, because of the highly boutique nature of many of those online marketplaces and the character of their shops' logos, we wanted to echo that through a simple graphic mark that we could include in promotions on the website, on social, and in the physical space. For that same reason, we chose to break out brand rules and go outside the brand house for these fonts. We used a specific gradient when presenting the Maker Market graphic in color—Midwest Mint and Flyover Fuschia, like other gradients in the suite, both of these are from the Institute's brand colors."
