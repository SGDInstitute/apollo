Whether the goal is advocacy for a cause, mobilizing people around an injustice, tightening a community through art and music, or bringing laughter and joy to your followers– media and content creation is a strong tool for gender justice and sexual liberation.'

            text: 'In 1974 the first queer Star Trek fanfic was published, starring Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. Now, almost 50 years later, Kirk and Spock remain a much-loved fanfiction couple. Yet, much has changed in the ways we view gender and sexuality across the past five decades. In this session, I’ll discuss what fanfiction can tell us about changing cultural constructions of LGBTQ+ identities, through a comparative analysis of over 6, 000 pages of Kirk/Spock fanfiction. '

I begin with an overview of my research on the practice of disidentification among queer youth in the One Direction/Harry Styles fandom and share findings which explicate their use of disidentification as a strategy of resistance. This will lead into a guided discussion about attendees'' personal experiences of disidentification.'
