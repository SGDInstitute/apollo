relationship: "I'm a queer intersex person who currently lives in Grand Forks, North Dakota. I have been living in the Midest for four years, where I have volunteered with the University of North Dakota Pride Center as a peer mentor, a faculty mentor, and a support group leader. I believe strongly in community-building through consensus modeling. I have never had the opportunity to work at an organization which was primarily focused on serving LGBTQIA2s+ communities, and I want to become more involved in this area because of my personal connection to it and the importance it holds for me as an individual and a member of this community more broadly."

experience: "I'm a triple-Virgo who currently works as a teacher (primarily Writing, Leadership, and DEIJ focused courses and workshops) and project manager for a community-building neighborhood focused non-profit in Grand Forks, North Dakota. I have an MA in English and Pedagogy and a BA in Literature and Philosophy. I am a published poet and essayist. For the last four years, I have volunteered with the University of North Dakota Pride Center as a peer mentor, a faculty mentor, and a support group leader. In the past, I have volunteered and for and worked at social service organizations (i.e.: intimate partner violence and trafficking shelters) and other community projects (i.e.: arts organizations, neighborhood groups, civic engagement or community wellness organizations, and public parks/community farm co-ops) as well as universities and schools in North Dakota (as well as in NJ where I am originally from). Most of my volunteer work has been around meeting facilitation, event planning, grant writing, or digital content creation and management."
