summary: 'We take (another) bite out of the trans policy issues surrounding anti-trans legislation targeting participation in sports. We’ve pulled the audio from our queer policy event from July 2021 for this special episode as we continue to monitor the impact of these policies in current time. This discussion between Katie Barnes, espn feature writer; Chris Mosier, Olympic Trials athlete and founder of TransAthlete.com; and Naomi Goldberg, deputy director and LGBTQ program director at the Movement Advancement Project makes important connections between the larger movement for trans justice and what’s happening in the world of professional, collegiate and K-12 sports.
