            text: "One of the major lessons learned through this pandemic is the need for hybrid options at large-scale events. As we continue to contend with the impacts of the health crisis and ensure Midwest queer and trans folks can engage with the conference, we are committed to providing a virtual experience tailored specifically for a digital-first audience– meaning we will ensure all content available to virtual ticket-holders is curated to prioritize their experience and that presenters/facilitators will be selected based on skills and experience working with virtual audiences.\_"
