The wide world of identity can be intimidating to navigate, especially for folks exploring their identities and attempting to find community. All too often our history can be inaccessible, or worse, inaccurate causing misunderstandings, frustration, and community turmoil. TERF Wars dives into the many facets of sapphic sexuality, gender, and orientation, to help you figure out what the L is going on.'

I will share my journey of discovering ways to ease the inflammation, change the story I tell myself, and dare to live as my authentic self.'

Even with how inclusive our communities, media, social movements, and spaces can be, there is much work to do. Trans people endure inequalities, civil rights violations, and violence because of ignorance, fear, and prejudice toward their identities even from other LGBTQ+ people. When we recognize and confront these inequalities we make safer, more inclusive spaces for trans people to exist in.'

It will discuss the intricacies of finding our people, building grassroots resources, and navigating multi-community dynamics inherent to Midwestern (and other politically conservative) environments in the face of poverty, isolation, and self-preservation.'

            text: 'Queer and trans (QT) educational trainings can often occur at the detriment of QT individuals in the space that may feel tokenized or experience harm for the benefit of non-QT folks’ learning. In this workshop I plan to exam the ways in which we can center QT peoples’ learning in educational trainings. We plan on re-focusing our assessment efforts to better understand the gaps in educational support and personal development for QT individuals.'

            text: 'This workshop provides an opportunity to think critically about the subversive practice of disidentification and the creative ways LGBTQ+ youth enact agency in their coming-of-age experiences. I begin with an overview of my research on the practice of disidentification among queer youth in the One Direction/Harry Styles fandom and share findings which explicate their use of disidentification as a strategy of resistance. This will lead into a guided discussion about attendees'' personal experiences of disidentification.'
