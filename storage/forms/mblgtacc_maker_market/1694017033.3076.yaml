description: "I am a researcher affiliated with the University of Kansas. I previously spoke with Justin Drwencke about my current research study which is funded by ACPA and the Spencer Foundation. The study focuses on examining LGBTQ+ college students' healthy intimate relationships. My primary purpose for attending is participant recruitment. The study involves a 60-90 minute zoom interview, which we will conduct after the conference. Ideally, I would like to bring myself and two graduate student researchers. \r\n\r\nIn my conversation with Justin, I discussed my willingness to have a craft activity that provides a creative space for attendees to reflect and represent QT love and relationships. The study is a photo voice study that already includes art components and I think that adding this as a component to the table could be another interesting data point and space of engagement for attendees."
